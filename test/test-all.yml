# this docker-compose file runs the tests on each distro/database server combo that
# we have made a Dockerfile for.
#
# each of the Dockerfiles actually stands alone, so we're not really making use of
# docker-compose's composition capabilities - this just gives us a quick way to run
# tests on all these versions.
#
# to use it, run `docker-compose -f test/test-all-distros.yml build`.  note that the
# tests are run as part of the build, you don't need to run anything afterwards.
